**Project Overview**

**Objective**: Develop a machine learning model to classify iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.  
**Dataset**: The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), containing 150 samples with features like SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm, and the target Species.  
**Key Steps**:  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Remove duplicates, handle outliers, and standardize features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize distributions, correlations, and class balance.  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create a new feature (SepalPetalRatio).  
4. **Model Development and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models.  Compare accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation performance.  
5. **Model Performance Summary**: Summarize the model performance and give recommendations on the best model.
